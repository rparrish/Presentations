	abstract = {Atrial fibrillation ({AF}) commonly develops after cardiac valvular surgery. The objective of this study was to identify risk factors for postoperative {AF} following valvular surgery. A cohort of 915 consecutive adult patients undergoing isolated valvular surgery with preoperative sinus rhythm was analyzed. Univariate and independent multivariate risk factors for postoperative {AF} were determined. A second cohort of 305 patients with the same inclusion criteria was used to validate the multivariate predictors. Patients studied had a mean age of 56.1 +/- 14.7 years, 57.9\% were men, 79.6\% had a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, and their mean left atrial size was 46.2 +/- 9.3 mm. The incidence of postoperative {AF} was 36.7\%. Independent predictors of postoperative {AF} included: advanced age (odds ratio [{OR}] 1.506 per decade, 95\% confidence interval, [{CI}] 1.35 to 1.68, p = 0.0001); mitral stenosis ({OR} 2.066, {CI} 1.21 to 3.52, p = 0.0077); left atrial enlargement ({OR} 1.468, {CI} 1.07 to 2.01, p = 0.0165); use of systemic hypothermia ({OR} 0.572, {CI} 0.422 to 0.776, p = 0.0003); and a history of cardiac surgery ({OR} 0.676, {CI} 0.465 to 0.981, p = 0.0393). Among these variables, advanced age, mitral stenosis, and left atrial enlargement were confirmed as independent risk factors in the validation cohort.},

	issn = {0003-4975},
	abstract = {Between January 1, 1986, and December 31, 1991, 4,507 adult patients underwent cardiac surgical procedures requiring cardiopulmonary bypass. Of these patients, 3,983 patients who did not undergo operation for supraventricular tachycardia and who were in normal sinus rhythm preoperatively form the study group for the present study. Postoperatively, all patients were monitored continuously for the development of arrhythmias until the time of hospital discharge. The incidence of atrial arrhythmias requiring treatment for the most commonly performed operative procedures were as follows: coronary artery bypass grafting, 31.9\%; coronary artery bypass grafting and mitral valve replacement, 63.6\%; coronary artery bypass grafting and aortic valve replacement, 48.8\%; and heart transplantation, 11.1\%. For all patients considered collectively, the risk factors associated with an increased incidence of postoperative atrial arrhythmias (p {\textless} 0.05 by multivariate logistic regression) included increasing patient age, preoperative use of digoxin, history of rheumatic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and increasing aortic cross-clamp time. Postoperative atrial fibrillation was associated with an increased incidence of postoperative stroke (3.3\% versus 1.4\%; p {\textless} 0.0005), increased length of hospitalization in the intensive care unit (5.7 versus 3.4 days; p = 0.001) and postoperative nursing ward (10.9 versus 7.5 days; p = 0.0001), increased incidence of postoperative ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (9.2\% versus 4.0\%; p {\textless} 0.0005), and an increased need for placement of a permanent pacemaker (3.7\% versus 1.6\%; p {\textless} 0.0005). These data provide a basis for targeting specific patient subgroups for prospective, randomized trials of therapeutic modalities designed to decrease the incidence of postoperative atrial arrhythmias.},

	abstract = {Atrial Fibrillation ({AF}) is the most common arrhythmia occurring after cardiac surgery. Its incidence varies depending on type of surgery. Postoperative {AF} may cause hemodynamic deterioration, predispose to stroke and increase mortality. Effective treatment for prophylaxis of postoperative {AF} is vital as reduces hospitalization and overall morbidity. Beta-blockers, have been proved to prevent effectively atrial fibrillation following cardiac surgery and should be routinely used if there are no contraindications. Sotalol may be more effective than standard b-blockers for the prevention of {AF} without causing an excess of side effects. Amiodarone is useful when beta-blocker therapy is not possible or as additional prophylaxis in high risk patients. Other agents such as magnesium, calcium channels blocker or non-antiarrhythmic drugs as glycose-insulin--potassium, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, N-acetylcysteine and statins have been studied as alternative treatment for postoperative {AF} prophylaxis.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: To review the epidemiology, mechanisms, complications, predictors, prevention, and treatment of atrial fibrillation following cardiac surgery.
{DATA} {SOURCES}: {MEDLINE} search of English-language reports published between 1966 and 2000 and a search of references of relevant papers.
{STUDY} {SELECTION}: Clinical and basic research studies on atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery.
{DATA} {EXTRACTION}: Relevant clinical information was extracted from selected articles.
{DATA} {SYNTHESIS}: Atrial fibrillation occurs in 10\% to 65\% of patients after cardiac surgery, usually on the second or third postoperative day. Postoperative atrial fibrillation is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and longer, more expensive hospital stays. Prophylactic use of beta-adrenergic blockers reduces the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation and should be administered before and after cardiac surgery to all patients without contraindication. Prophylactic amiodarone and atrial overdrive pacing should be considered in patients at high risk for postoperative atrial fibrillation (for example, patients with previous atrial fibrillation or mitral valve surgery). For patients who develop atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery, a strategy of rhythm management or rate management should be selected. For patients who are hemodynamically unstable or highly symptomatic or who have a contraindication to anticoagulation, rhythm management with electrical cardioversion, amiodarone, or both is preferred. Treatment of the remaining patients should focus on rate control because most will spontaneously revert to sinus rhythm within 6 weeks after discharge. All patients with atrial fibrillation persisting for more than 24 to 48 hours and without contraindication should receive anticoagulation.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Atrial fibrillation frequently complicates cardiac surgery. Many cases can be prevented with appropriate prophylactic therapy. A strategy of rhythm management for symptomatic patients and rate management for all other patients usually results in reversion to sinus rhythm within 6 weeks of discharge.},
