Looks like a maze but it's not

Prayer, medidation * mindfullness

State your intention before entering: 
- anything that is troubling you
- "I want a solution to my problem with..."

# The Maze and the Labyrinth


.pull-left[
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("768px-Prim_Maze.svg.png")

```

]

.pull-right[

### Maze
1. Goal is to reach the destination

1. Multiple entrances, exits, and dead-ends.

1. Difficult to recall/reproduce the route

]

# The Maze and the Labyrinth


.pull-left[
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("768px-Labyrinthus.svg.png")

```

]

.pull-right[

### Labyrinth
1. Goal is to find peace and understanding

1. Single route to the center and back to entrance

1. Can easily reproduce how we got there

## Terminology 

.pull-left[

#### Report
- Tabular data
- Excel files, on-screen or printed
- Reporting Workbench/InfoView

#### Dashboard
- Multiple graphs or plots
- Interactive or static
- Tableau/Vantage/etc.


]

--

.pull-right[
#### Raw Data
- No formatting or plots
- Intended for computers
- Excel or .csv format

]


---

## Terminology 

.pull-left[
#### Clinical Analytics
- planning/data collection
- cleaning/preparation
- analysis
- data presentation

]

--

.pull-right[

#### Data Science
- a formal discipline of turning raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge. 
- Programming tools instead of GUI software
- Computer science & statistics
]

#### The Data Science process

## What types of Analytics requests are you getting?

--
- "I need a report..."
- "Can we 'tweak' this dashboard to ..." 
- "Can you pull a list of patients ..."
- "I just need a ..."


--

   > What they __request__  
   > is not always what they __want__  
   > which may not be what they __need__
  
---
## Restate the issue

- "What question(s) are you trying to answer?"
- "What problem are you trying to solve?"

--
- 5 Whys

--
- User Stories

> "As a `<type of user>`,  
> I want `<some goal>`   
> so that I can `<some action>`."  


---
## Restate the issue

### PICOT
   - Population
   - Intervention
   - Comparison
   - Outcome
   - Time






> Among patients with ICD implants, did the use of antibiotic pouches decrease the incidence of infection compared to patients without pouches over the past 5 years?


---
## Restating the issue

### Clinical Analysis
 - What is being requested? Purpose or use? 
 - Population of interest - Inclusions & Exclusions 
 - Intervention or comparision groups?
 - Outcomes/Variables?
 - Date Ranges? 

---

# Data requirements

- What raw data is required?
- What level of detail? 
   - individual patients
   - procedures
- What are the potential data sources?
- Do multiple datasets need be merged?
- Any modifications? (cleaning or reshaping)

--

.pull-left[
#### Long data

```{r, echo = FALSE}
mydata <- dplyr::tribble(
  ~CSN, ~MEAS_NAME, ~Value,
  "1234", "BP", "118/80",
  "1234", "Pulse", "80",

#### Wide data

```{r, echo = FALSE}
mydata_wide <- 
  mydata %>%
  tidyr::spread(MEAS_NAME, Value) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(SBP = gsub("/.*", "", BP)) 

knitr::kable(mydata_wide, format = 'html')

# Some Tips


.pull-left[

Organize analytics projects in a __standard file structure__

- Always keep an unmodified version of the original raw data
- `Reports:` contains the final analysis
- `Resources:` Reference documents, articles, etc.
- `SQL/R/Tableau:` Any programming code used in project
- README document contains information about the project intent, etc.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}

# Some Tips

Raw data files should be __tidy__.
- Each table is an observational unit (ie. patient vs. procedure)
- Each row is a single observation
- Each column is a single variable

.pull-left[

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = ""}
messy <- dplyr::tribble(
  ~CSN,  ~`Age/sex`, ~`Diagnosis/Admit_date`, 
  "123", "72 F", "Acute MI", 
  " ",    " ",    "2018-07-04",
  "456", "68 M", "Stroke", 
  "  ",   " ",     "2018-08-01"
)

knitr::kable(head(messy), format = 'html', caption = "messy data")

```
]

.pull-right[

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tidy_data <- dplyr::tribble(
  ~CSN,  ~Age, ~Sex, ~Diagnosis, ~Admit_date, 
  "123", "72", "F", "Acute MI", "2018-07-04",
  "456", "68", "M", "Stroke",   "2018-08-01"
)

knitr::kable(head(tidy_data), format = 'html', caption = "tidy data")

```
] 

---


# Some Tips

Data from different sources can be __joined__ using identifier fields (ie. MRN, HAR, CSN)

.pull-left[
_Demographics_

```{r, echo = FALSE}
demog <- dplyr::tribble(
  ~CSN,  ~Diagnosis, ~Admit_date,
  "1234", "Acute MI", "2018-07-04",
  "5678", "Stroke", "2018-08-01"
)

knitr::kable(head(demog), format = 'html')

```

]

.pull-right[
_Vitals_

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(mydata_wide), format = 'html')

```
]




```{r, echo = FALSE}
demog %>%
  inner_join(mydata_wide, by = "CSN") %>% 
  knitr::kable(., format = 'html')
  

```

This means that you aren't limited to using a single data source or reporting system.

# Wrap up


1. Start with good questions 
1. May need multiple data sources
1. May need to prep the data for analysis 
1. Visualizations can help find patterns
