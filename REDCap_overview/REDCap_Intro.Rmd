## Quality Improvement data
<div class="columns-2">
### Motivation
- We used Excel for nearly everything
- Excessive time spent copying & pasting data, emailing files, cleaning/fixing errors, etc.

###  Needed a solution that was:
 - Inexpensive and did not require software installation (Cheap)
 - Compliant / Data Management Best Practices  (Good)
 - Easy to develop, deploy & use (Fast)
