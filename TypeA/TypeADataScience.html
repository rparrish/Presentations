# Types of Data Science
&gt; Michael Hochster (Quora post)

### Type A 
&gt; The A is for Analysis. This type is primarily 
&gt; concerned with making sense of data or working with it in a fairly static way. 
&gt; The Type A Data Scientist is very similar to a statistician (and may be one) 
&gt; but knows all the practical details of working with data that aren’t taught 
&gt; in the statistics curriculum: data cleaning, methods for dealing with very 
&gt; large data sets, visualization, deep knowledge of a particular domain, 
&gt; writing well about data, and so on.

# Type A &amp; Type B Data Scientists
&gt; Michael Hochster (Quora post)

### Type B  
&gt; The B is for Building. Type B Data Scientists share some statistical background 
&gt; with Type A, but they are also very strong coders  and may be trained software 
&gt; engineers. The Type B Data Scientist is mainly 
&gt; interested in using data “in production.” They build models which interact 
&gt; with users, often serving recommendations (products, people you may know, 
&gt; ads, movies, search results).

# R Code

```r
# a boring regression
fit = lm(dist ~ 1 + speed, data = cars)
coef(summary(fit))
```

```
#               Estimate Std. Error   t value     Pr(&gt;|t|)
# (Intercept) -17.579095  6.7584402 -2.601058 1.231882e-02
# speed         3.932409  0.4155128  9.463990 1.489836e-12
```

# R Plots


```r
par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, .1))
plot(cars, pch = 19, col = 'darkgray', las = 1)
abline(fit, lwd = 2)
```
