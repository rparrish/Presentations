# Background

# Types of Data Science
> Michael Hochster (Quora post)

### Type A 
> The A is for Analysis. This type is primarily 
> concerned with making sense of data or working with it in a fairly static way. 
> The Type A Data Scientist is very similar to a statistician (and may be one) 
> but knows all the practical details of working with data that aren’t taught 
> in the statistics curriculum: data cleaning, methods for dealing with very 
> large data sets, visualization, deep knowledge of a particular domain, 
> writing well about data, and so on.

# Type A & Type B Data Scientists
> Michael Hochster (Quora post)

### Type B  
> The B is for Building. Type B Data Scientists share some statistical background 
> with Type A, but they are also very strong coders  and may be trained software 
> engineers. The Type B Data Scientist is mainly 
> interested in using data “in production.” They build models which interact 
> with users, often serving recommendations (products, people you may know, 
> ads, movies, search results).

# R Code
---
```{r comment='#'}
# a boring regression
fit = lm(dist ~ 1 + speed, data = cars)
coef(summary(fit))

```

---
# R Plots

```{r cars, fig.height=4, dev='svg'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, .1))
plot(cars, pch = 19, col = 'darkgray', las = 1)
abline(fit, lwd = 2)
```
