# Background

# Types of Data Science

### Type A 
> The A is for Analysis. This type is primarily 
> concerned with making sense of data or working with it in a fairly static way. 
> The Type A Data Scientist is very similar to a statistician (and may be one) 
> but knows all the practical details of working with data that aren’t taught 
> in the statistics curriculum: data cleaning, methods for dealing with very 
> large data sets, visualization, deep knowledge of a particular domain, 
> writing well about data, and so on.

# Type A & Type B Data Scientists

### Type B  
> The B is for Building. Type B Data Scientists share some statistical background 
> with Type A, but they are also very strong coders  and may be trained software 
> engineers. The Type B Data Scientist is mainly 
> interested in using data “in production.” They build models which interact 
> with users, often serving recommendations (products, people you may know, 
> ads, movies, search results).

> Michael Hochster (Quora post)

# Comparison

Common ground 
- Programming Languages 
- Reproducibile
- Common Tool kits: R/Python/SAS, SQL, Regular Expressions, Version Control, etc.

.pull-left[
## Type A - analysis

Smaller Datasets  
Traditional Statistics

Output: 
  - Analysis (written report, presentation, blog post, article)
  - Data Wrangling
  - Automation/ETL
]
  
.pull-right[
## Type B - build
"Big Data"  
Machine Learning/Deep Learning  

Output: 
  - Applications
  - Large scale models
  - Recommender systems

# Approach 

1. R / R-Studio 
2. R Packages  
  - tidyverse
  - dplyr & magrittr (pipes)
  - ggplot2
  - Rmarkdown
  
3. Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization (Coursera.org)

# Examples 

- ProvInfo reports (blood products)
- Multiple data sources  
  - TYREX pouch utilization
  - SSOS Contract Incentives)
- Mortality Reviews (EDW, REDCap, email)

# R Code
---
```{r comment='#'}
# a boring regression
fit = lm(dist ~ 1 + speed, data = cars)
coef(summary(fit))

```

---
# R Plots

```{r cars, fig.height=4, dev='svg'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, .1))
plot(cars, pch = 19, col = 'darkgray', las = 1)
abline(fit, lwd = 2)
```
