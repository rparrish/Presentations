## What is the EDW?


- Brings data from disparate sources to single location
- Standard naming conventions regardless of source  
    - ie. "MRN" vs "PatientID", vs "medical_record"
- Contains data from 
    - Epic 
    - Lawson
    - Premier
    - many others  
- Large SQL Server instance with 1 Terabyte of RAM



## How does it work?

- Data copied from Chronicles (Cache) to Clarity then to EDW every morning
- Primarily used to build standardized reports:
    - ProvInfo
