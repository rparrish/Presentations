# Development Strategy

## Reproducible Analytics/Research

- Analytics/Research is "reproducible" when you and others can get the exact same results using the same data. 
- "High Reliability Analytics"

Article - [Spreadsheets are slowing our progress](https://towardsdatascience.com/spreadsheets-are-slowing-our-progress-caa1f7709302) - Keith McNulty - March 7, 2019 


## Tools

- R/RStudio - Integrated Development Environment
- SQL (Toad Data Point)
- Git (version control)
- Jira (project management) 
- "Inner Source": adopting "open source" practices and tools within an organization

# Data Products

## TAVR: Are there a significant differences between the two devices?

.pull-left[
#### Initial request 

 - comparison table of basic demographics
 - 1 year AVMG and % over 20mm
 - list of cases > 20mm  
   
__Product:__ _[TAVR AVMG at 1 year](./TAVR_1yr_follow_up_mean_gradients 2019-05-24.pdf)_  
__Code repository:__ _[TAVR gradients](https://bitbucket.org/p348411/tavr_23x26/src/master/TAVR_gradients/TAVR_gradients.Rmd)_

]

.pull-right[
#### Next request 

 - All available data elements from TVT Registry (300+ fields)
 - Construct a 'Table 1' 
 - All follow-up periods (immediately postop, initial follow-up, & 1 year)

# Data Products

## GWTG-CAD: import data file (ETL)

.pull-left[
### Background
- Clinical registry by American Heart Association
- Web-based data entry forms with ability to upload data
- Existing queries/code for an similar process for GWTG-Stroke
- Local REDCap project for STEMI cases (timestamps)
]

.pull-right[
### Process
- Scheduled monthly
- R script pulls from EDW for elligible cases
- Joined with data from REDCap
- Creates properly formatted .csv file
- Sends email with attachment and instructions monthly 
- Manually uploaded to website
