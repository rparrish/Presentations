## Development Strategy
- Reproducible Analytics
- Clinical Data Science
- "Inner Source" 
- Education & skillset development 

## Data Products
- TAVR: device comparison
- GWTG-CAD: import data file
- REDCap: notification module

---

# Development Strategy

## Reproducible Analytics/Research

- Analytics and Research is "reproducible" when you and others can get the exact same results using the same data. 
- "High Reliability Analytics"
- Best achieved using programming code as opposed to Excel and "point and click" GUI software

# The Maze and the Labyrinth


.pull-left[
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("768px-Prim_Maze.svg.png")

```

]

.pull-right[

### Maze
1. Goal is to reach the destination

1. Multiple entrances, exits, and dead-ends.

1. Difficult to recall/reproduce the route

]



---

# The Maze and the Labyrinth


.pull-left[
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("768px-Labyrinthus.svg.png")

```

]

.pull-right[

### Labyrinth
1. Goal is to find peace and understanding

1. Single route to the center and back to entrance

1. Can easily reproduce how we got there

## Terminology 

.pull-left[
#### Clinical Analytics
- planning/data collection
- cleaning/preparation
- analysis
- data presentation

]

--

.pull-right[

#### Data Science
- a formal discipline of turning raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge. 
- Programming tools instead of GUI software
- Computer science & statistics
]

#### The Data Science process
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("data-science.png")

```

## Restating the issue

### Clinical Analysis
 - What is being requested? Purpose or use? 
 - Population of interest - Inclusions & Exclusions 
 - Intervention or comparision groups?
 - Outcomes/Variables?
 - Date Ranges? 

---

# Data requirements

- What raw data is required?
- What level of detail? 
   - individual patients
   - procedures
- What are the potential data sources?
- Do multiple datasets need be merged?
- Any modifications? (cleaning or reshaping)



---

# Some Tips


.pull-left[

Organize analytics projects in a __standard file structure__

- Always keep an unmodified version of the original raw data
- `Reports:` contains the final analysis
- `Resources:` Reference documents, articles, etc.
- `SQL/R/Tableau:` Any programming code used in project
- README document contains information about the project intent, etc.
